- **Background:** Elara was born into a poor neighborhood on the outskirts of Neo-Eden. She grew up on the streets, surviving by her wits and exceptional hacking skills. She eventually caught the attention of Ono-Sendai, who offered her a lucrative career as a Memory Hacker. However, her activities attracted unwanted attention from corporate security and law enforcement, leading her to go underground.

## Time of Death
- **Estimated Time of Death (ETD):** 02:47 AM, local time on March 15th, 2077

## Location
- **Crime Scene:** A dilapidated, abandoned warehouse located in the "Maelstrom" district, a notorious area known for its high crime rate and corrupt corporate presence. The warehouse is situated near the city's main sewer system, providing potential access to underground tunnels.

## Body Condition
- **Physical Description:** Elara's body was discovered in a prone position, with her arms and legs twisted at unnatural angles. Her skin had undergone significant decomposition, but visible injuries suggested a brutal assault. Notable findings include:
  - A 3-inch gash above her left eyebrow, possibly inflicted by a sharp object.
  - Severe bruising on her neck, consistent with manual strangulation.
  - Two bullet wounds to the chest and abdomen, indicating a possible struggle with multiple assailants.

## Evidence Found
- **Physical Evidence:**
  - A pair of custom-made, high-tech gloves at the scene, bearing DNA samples from the victim and an unknown individual.
  - A cyberdeck (a portable hacking device) partially disassembled near the body, suggesting it was forcibly removed post-mortem.
  - A micro-drone (a small, autonomous flying drone) hovering above the warehouse entrance, still operational but equipped with a data log containing encrypted files.
- **Digital Evidence:**
  - A deleted email on Elara's personal comms device, referencing a mysterious meeting with an individual known only as "Zero Cool."
  - Encrypted files recovered from the cyberdeck, hinting at Elara's involvement in high-stakes corporate espionage.

## Surroundings
- **Warehouse Conditions:** The warehouse was dimly lit, with flickering fluorescent lights overhead. Dust-covered crates and boxes filled most of the space, providing ample cover for potential hiding spots or escape routes. A small, makeshift laboratory area contained various gadgets and equipment, suggesting Elara's involvement in her work as a Memory Hacker.
- **Neighborhood Atmosphere:** The Maelstrom district is notorious for its crime and corruption. Streets are narrow and winding, with tall, imposing corporate skyscrapers looming above the cramped residential areas. The air reeks of exhaust fumes, garbage, and the distant hum of cyberware enhancements.
