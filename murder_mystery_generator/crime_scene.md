- Occupation: Lead hacker at Omicron Innovations
- Background: Mayra was a brilliant hacker who had worked for several high-profile clients in the shadows of the corporate world. Her skills were highly sought after, and she was known to be fiercely independent.

## Time of Death 
The body was discovered at approximately 03:45 AM on February 15th, 2077.

## Location 
The crime scene is located in a seedy part of the sprawling metropolis, within the limits of the sprawling sprawl that is Night City. The location is in an abandoned warehouse on 14th and Main Street, a dilapidated building with boarded-up windows and a crooked sign creaking in the wind.

## Body Condition 
Mayra's body was discovered in a contorted position near a damaged server terminal. Her eyes were wide open, staring blankly into space. The skin around her eyes had begun to discolor, giving an impression of extreme emotional distress at the moment of death. Her hair was disheveled, and she showed signs of having been restrained at some point.

## Evidence Found 
- A torn piece of fabric caught in the lock of a nearby air vent.
- Several scattered wires from an abandoned cyberdeck on the floor.
- The remains of a partially consumed cup of coffee on a dusty workbench.
- Bloodstains on the terminal's keyboard and surrounding equipment, indicating that Mayra had been typing when she was killed.

## Surroundings 
The warehouse is dimly lit by flickering fluorescent lights overhead. The air is thick with dust, and there are signs of recent scavenging, including scattered junk and discarded computer parts. A broken door leads out into the night, while a narrow staircase ascends to a dimly lit mezzanine level.
