## Thought
I will create a clear and engaging plot for a murder mystery story set in the year 2077, based on the topic "Cyberpunk". The story involves 4 suspects, each with a clear motive for killing the victim. I will ensure that the true culprit is one of the 4 suspects, and include detailed information about the victim's identity, the crime scene, the suspects, and how the true culprit committed the murder.

## Crime Scene
The crime scene is situated within a nondescript, high-rise corporate office building located in the downtown area of Neo-Tokyo. The exact address is **2021-01 CyberCorp Plaza, Neo-Tokyo, Japan**. Upon arrival at the crime scene, I observed that Elara Vex's body was found in a seated position, slumped over a worn, leather-bound chair. Her attire consisted of a black, high-collared jacket with metallic accents, along with a pair of durable, knee-high boots and a sleek, silver necklace featuring an Ono-Sendai insignia.

## True Culprit
The true culprit behind Elara Vex's murder is **Hiroharu Nakasuna**.

After conducting further investigations and gathering evidence, it was revealed that Hiroharu's troubled past and sense of purpose were indeed connected to Elara's line of work. As a demon hunter, she had been tracking an ancient evil linked to Ono-Sendai Corporation, which threatened the city of Neo-Tokyo. However, during her investigation, she stumbled upon a cryptic message from an unknown sender, hinting at the corporation's involvement in supernatural activities.

Hiroharu became obsessed with uncovering the truth and joined forces with Elara Vex to investigate further. Unbeknownst to Elara, Hiroharu had been working secretly with Ono-Sendai Corporation to eliminate any threats they deemed too great for their interests. When Elara discovered the corporation's dark secret, she threatened to expose them, putting her own life at risk.

In a desperate attempt to silence Elara, Hiroharu used her expertise as a demon hunter and combined it with her knowledge of Ono-Sendai Corporation's security measures to commit the perfect crime. She used an advanced device to disable the building's internal security system, and then used biometric lockpicks to gain access to Elara's office.

The crescent-shaped wound on Elara's cheekbone was inflicted using a custom-made device designed by Hiroharu herself. The 9mm pistol found on the floor was planted to mislead investigators and point to an alternative suspect. The metallic data pad containing encrypted files was a red herring, meant to distract from Hiroharu's true motives.

The synthetic fibers caught in Elara's fingernails were from Hiroharu's own clothing, which she had carefully placed there as evidence of her involvement. The set of biometric lockpicks on the work surface was another clever misdirection, designed to lead investigators away from her own identity.

The scuff marks on the floor and the cracked security camera lens suggested that Hiroharu had indeed followed up on Elara after committing the crime, further solidifying her guilt. However, it was ultimately the fibers caught in the chair's upholstery that sealed her fate â€“ they matched Hiroharu's bespoke suit, revealing her true identity as the killer.

As investigators closed in on Hiroharu Nakasuna, she realized too late that her troubled past and sense of purpose had blinded her to the dangers of her own ambition. The truth behind Elara Vex's murder would remain a dark secret forever, hidden within the labyrinthine corridors of Ono-Sendai Corporation's sinister empire.
