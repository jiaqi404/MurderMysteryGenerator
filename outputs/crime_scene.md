## Victim Details
- Name: **Mayra Elara Vex**
- Age: 32
- Occupation: Former Netrunner and Freelance Hacker
- Background: Mayra was a skilled hacker who had worked for various corporations and individuals in the shadows of the cyberpunk underworld. She was known for her exceptional skills in infiltrating even the most secure systems, but also had a reputation for being reckless and impulsive.

## Time of Death
The estimated time of death is between 02:00 AM and 03:00 AM of March 15th, 2077.

## Location
The crime scene is located in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of Neo-Tokyo's Kabukicho district. The address is 345-1246 Katagiri Street, a nondescript building with metal doors and no visible signage. The area surrounding the warehouse appears to be deserted at this hour, with only the faint hum of traffic from the nearby streets breaking the silence.

## Body Condition
When discovered by the responding officers, Mayra's body was found in a seated position on the floor of a dimly lit room deep within the warehouse. Her eyes were frozen in a permanent stare, and her skin had a deathly pale complexion. The once vibrant purple hair that cascaded down her back was now matted with blood and dust. A series of shallow cuts adorned her neck, wrists, and ankles, suggesting a violent struggle. The body showed no signs of major trauma, but the internal organs had been removed, indicating a possible ritualistic or symbolic act.

## Evidence Found
- A small data crystal containing encrypted files was found on Mayra's person.
- A fragment of a rare, high-end smartgun cartridge was discovered near the wound site.
- A set of fingerprints matching those of a known cybernetic enhancement dealer were found on a nearby console.
- A piece of torn fabric caught in the warehouse door's lock bore an unfamiliar insignia, possibly related to Mayra's activities.

## Surroundings
The abandoned warehouse itself appears to have been used for illicit activities, with various tools and equipment scattered throughout the space. The walls are adorned with cryptic messages scrawled in blood, seemingly from previous victims or clients. A small, makeshift laboratory area contains various pieces of cyberware and hacking equipment. The air is thick with the smell of smoke and ozone, and the only light comes from flickering fluorescent tubes overhead.

A faint scent of artificial lavender wafts through the air, possibly a lingering signature left by Mayra herself or someone else. The silence is oppressive, punctuated only by the distant hum of drones and the soft glow of holographic advertisements on nearby streetlights. It's clear that this was no ordinary murder â€“ Mayra's death has been carefully orchestrated to send a message.
