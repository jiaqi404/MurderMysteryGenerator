## Victim Details - Name: **Aurora Sinistra**
- Age: 25
- Occupation: Aria Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Magic
- Background: Aurora was a talented young witch and musician who had just begun her career as an Aria Professor at Hogwarts. She was known for her exceptional voice and her ability to connect with students on a personal level.

## Time of Death
The body was discovered at approximately **2:47 AM** on November 15th, 1999.

## Location
The crime scene is located in the **Musical Instruments Storage Room**, which is situated within the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Magic. The room is typically used to store instruments and musical equipment, but it has also been known as a quiet spot for students to practice or study when the castle is closed.

## Body Condition
When discovered by the Hogwarts staff, Aurora's body was found slumped against a shelf in the back of the storage room, with her head resting on a stack of old music sheets. She had suffered a single blow to the chest, which resulted in significant internal damage and a fatal wound. Her eyes were open, staring blankly into space, and her skin had a faintly blue tint.

## Evidence Found
* A torn piece of fabric was caught in the shelf near Aurora's head.
* A silver-tipped wand lay on the floor nearby, partially hidden under a nearby stack of crates.
* A small, leather-bound book was found open on the workbench, with several pages torn out and scattered about.
* There were faint marks of magic on the walls and shelves, indicating that the killer may have used dark magic to move or hide evidence.

## Surroundings
The storage room is a dimly lit area with rows of shelves lining the walls. The air is musty and filled with the scent of old books and dust. In the center of the room, there is a large wooden workbench where Aurora was found slumped against it. The shelves are stacked haphazardly with musical instruments, sheet music, and various other items related to music and magic. The door is old and creaky, with a large iron doorknob in the shape of an owl.
