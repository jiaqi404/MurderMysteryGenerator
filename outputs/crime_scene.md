## Victim Details 
### Name:
**Lord Thomas Worthington III**
### Age: 32
### Occupation: Duke of Ashwood and Member of Parliament
### Background: Born into a noble family, Lord Worthington was known for his charismatic personality, ambition, and ruthlessness in politics. He was a prominent figure in the royal court, often finding himself at odds with other powerful families.

## Time of Death 
The estimated time of death is between 10 pm and 12 am on the night of March 20, 1800.

## Location 
The crime scene is located within the grand ballroom of Worthington Manor, a majestic estate nestled in the English countryside. The manor is situated approximately 30 miles northwest of London, surrounded by dense forests and rolling hills.

## Body Condition 
Lord Worthington's body was discovered face-down on the marble floor, near the fireplace. His eyes were wide open, staring at some unseen horror. A crimson stain, roughly 6 inches in diameter, had spread across his chest from a single stab wound. His hands were clasped together, and his fingers were stiff, indicating that he had died shortly after falling.

## Evidence Found 
A silver letter opener with an intricately engraved handle was found near the victim's left hand. The opener displayed faint scratches on its blade, suggesting it may have been used to inflict the fatal wound. Nearby, a torn piece of fabric caught in a nearby candelabra's metalwork. The fabric appears to be from a black coat with a distinctive red lining.

## Surroundings 
The grand ballroom was in disarray, with overturned chairs and shattered candelabras scattered about. The room's occupants had fled in haste, leaving behind a trail of confusion and panic. A faint scent of cigar smoke lingered in the air, suggesting that one or more individuals may have been smoking before the murder. A nearby door, leading to the library, was found open, as if someone had recently passed through it. The atmosphere is heavy with tension, and an eerie silence pervades the area.
