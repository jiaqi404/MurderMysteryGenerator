## Victim Details - Name: Elwynn Asteria
- Age: 32
- Occupation: Apprentice Enchantress at the Wysteria Academy of Magic
- Background: Elwynn was a talented young witch from a family of skilled magic-users. She had been studying at the Wysteria Academy for five years, specializing in elemental magic and spellcraft.

## Time of Death - Estimated: 10:45 PM, 23rd February 1999


## Location
The crime scene is located within the restricted area of the Wysteria Academy's Great Hall. The room is a large, high-ceilinged chamber with long tables and benches arranged in a semi-circle around a central dais. The walls are adorned with intricate carvings of magical creatures and symbols.

## Body Condition
Elwynn's body was found lying on the floor, approximately 20 feet away from the central dais. She was positioned in a unnatural pose, with her arms and legs splayed out to the sides. Her eyes were open, and her pupils had constricted into tiny pinpoints, giving her an eerily lifelike appearance. A thin layer of frost coated her skin, despite the warmth of the Great Hall.

## Evidence Found - Initial Observations:
- A broken crystal orb lies shattered on the floor near Elwynn's head.
- A torn piece of black silk fabric is caught in a nearby candelabra.
- A faint smudge of silver dust is visible on the edge of the dais, possibly from a spell or potion.
- Elwynn's body shows signs of having been subjected to a magical binding spell, with subtle scars and burns on her wrists and ankles.

## Surroundings
The Great Hall was in disarray, with chairs overturned and tables knocked over. The air was thick with the scent of burned incense and ozone. A faint hum of magic lingered, like the whispers of forgotten spells. The candles that lined the walls cast flickering shadows on the walls, making it seem as though the very spirits of the dead were watching from the darkness.
