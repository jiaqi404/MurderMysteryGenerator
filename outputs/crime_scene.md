## Victim Details
### Name:
Dr. Sophia Wong
### Age:
28 years old
### Occupation:
Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the Department of Information Technology
### Background:
Born and raised in Hong Kong, Dr. Wong was a rising star in her field, known for her innovative approach to artificial intelligence and machine learning. She had received numerous awards and publications in top-tier conferences.

## Time of Death
The time of death is estimated to be between 10:45 PM and 11:15 PM on a Tuesday evening, based on the forensic analysis of the victim's phone and the surrounding environment.

## Location
The crime scene is located at Room 304, Block A, the Hong Kong University Student Residence Building, situated in the heart of the university campus. The room is a standard single occupancy dormitory with basic furnishings.

## Body Condition
Upon discovery, Dr. Wong's body was found slumped over her desk, with her head resting on a pile of notes and research papers. Her eyes were open, staring blankly at the wall, and her skin had a pale, almost translucent quality. There were no visible signs of forced entry or struggle, but her wrists showed faint scratches. The body was dressed in a pair of yoga pants, a white tank top, and a pair of scuffed-up sneakers.

## Evidence Found
* A shattered smartphone on the floor, with cracked screens and scattered papers around it.
* A single drop of blood on the desk's edge, near the victim's right hand.
* A torn piece of fabric caught in the window latch, suggesting a possible exit or entry point.
* A set of footprints leading from the room to the adjacent corridor, partially erased by the university's cleaning staff.

## Surroundings
The surrounding areas were relatively quiet, with only a few students walking by the residence building around 11:15 PM. The campus was well-lit, with security cameras installed throughout the buildings. However, it appeared that no one had entered or exited Room 304 between 10:45 PM and 11:15 PM.

The room itself was tidy, but for a few scattered papers and books. Dr. Wong's desk was organized, with all her work materials neatly arranged in labeled folders and containers. The window was slightly ajar, allowing a gentle breeze to circulate through the room. On the wall opposite the bed, there was a large poster of the Hong Kong skyline, with a quote from Confucius in Chinese characters.

As Crime Scene Investigator, I will carefully document every detail at this scene and work to unravel the mysteries surrounding Dr. Wong's tragic demise.
