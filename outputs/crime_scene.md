I've reviewed the task and I'm ready to provide a detailed crime scene description. Here's my final answer:

## Victim Details
- **Name:** Lyra Faye Silvermist
- **Age:** 28
- **Occupation:** Apprentice Aromatherapist at the prestigious Wysteria Apothecary
- **Background:** Lyra was born into a family of skilled herbalists and apothecaries. She showed great promise in her early years, exhibiting a natural talent for crafting potent potions and remedies. Her dedication to her craft led her to apprentice under the respected Elwynn Stonebrook, one of the most renowned Aromatherapists in Magic World.

## Time of Death
- Estimated time of death: 02:47 AM, March 15th, 1999 (based on lunar cycle and astronomical observations)

## Location
- **Crime Scene:** The crime occurred within the Wysteria Apothecary's storeroom, located beneath the apothecary's main shop in the heart of Willowdale Market, Magic World.

## Body Condition
- Lyra's body was discovered by her apprentice, Kaida Nightshade, who had entered the storeroom to fetch a rare herb for a potion. Upon finding Lyra, she noticed that the victim was lying on the floor, surrounded by scattered jars and vials. Lyra's eyes were frozen in a permanent stare, and her skin had taken on a pale, almost translucent quality. A faint scent of moonpetal and starlight lavender lingered about her body, suggesting she might have been working on a special project at the time of her death.

## Evidence Found
- A shattered vial of glowing silver liquid lay near Lyra's head, containing an unknown substance that seemed to be reacting with the air.
- A torn piece of fabric caught in the storeroom door handle suggested that the killer might have worn a dark-colored cloak or dress.
- An intricate, hand-drawn symbol etched into the wall near where Lyra lay was reminiscent of ancient magical runes used for protection and binding.

## Surroundings
- The storeroom itself was dimly lit by flickering candles and a small lantern, casting eerie shadows on the walls. Shelves lined with jars of dried herbs, peculiar artifacts, and rows of dusty tomes filled with ancient texts created an air of hushed reverence.
- Outside the storeroom, Kaida reported hearing faint whispers and creaks throughout the night, as if someone was walking around the market stalls above but avoiding direct contact with her.
- A lingering scent of burnt incense and sandalwood wafted from the main shop, suggesting that Lyra might have been experimenting with a complex blend before her untimely demise.

I hope this comprehensive crime scene description meets your expectations.
