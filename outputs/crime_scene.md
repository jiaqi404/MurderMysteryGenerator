## Victim Details
### Name:
**Bertha Jinglewhiff**
### Age:
42 years old
### Occupation:
Professor of Ancient Runes at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
### Background:
Born in a small village in the Scottish Highlands, Bertha was an accomplished linguist and expert in the study of ancient magical languages. She had been teaching at Hogwarts for over 15 years and was well-respected among her colleagues.

## Time of Death
The time of death is estimated to be around 10:00 PM on a chilly autumn evening, with the body discovered by the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Rubeus Hagrid, approximately two hours later.

## Location
The crime scene is located in Bertha's office, situated in one of the ancient towers of Hogwarts Castle. The office is situated near the restricted section of the library and is easily accessible through a hidden passageway from the castle's east wing.

## Body Condition
When Hagrid discovered the body, Bertha was found slumped over her desk, with her head resting on a stack of dusty tomes. Her eyes were frozen in a permanent stare, and her skin had taken on a pale, waxy complexion. A faint scent of old parchment and dust filled the air.

## Evidence Found
Several pieces of evidence were recovered from the scene:

*   A torn piece of fabric caught in the window lock, which appears to be a fragment of Bertha's own cloak.
*   A set of footprints leading from the office window down to the castle's east wing, which are now missing due to the body's position.
*   A broken quill pen on the floor, with an unusual residue that may indicate the use of a dark magic spell.
*   A small, hidden compartment in Bertha's desk drawer, containing a cryptic message scrawled on a piece of parchment.

## Surroundings
The office itself was in disarray, with books and papers scattered across the floor. The walls were lined with shelves, containing an assortment of ancient tomes and rare manuscripts. A large, ornate mirror hung above the desk, reflecting the dim light that filtered through the stained glass window.

A faint scent of smoke lingered in the air, suggesting that a fire may have been lit earlier that night. However, no signs of forced entry or struggle were apparent, leading investigators to suspect that Bertha's murder may have been a carefully planned and executed act.
