## True Culprit

The true culprit behind Dr. Sophia Wong's murder is revealed to be none other than Maya, the researcher from the Lunar Library. Her research into Echo Bonds and phantom friends had led her to a deep understanding of the supernatural forces at play in Hong Kong University, including the mysterious events connected to Jeff's family history.

Maya's connection to Dr. Wong was not just professional but also personal. The two women had collaborated on several projects, and Maya had come to admire Dr. Wong's work. However, as Maya delved deeper into her research, she began to see Dr. Wong's understanding of the supernatural as narrow and incomplete.

Maya's motive for the crime was not only to protect her own research but also to silence Dr. Wong, who she perceived as a threat to her reputation and credibility in the academic community. The scratches on Dr. Wong's wrists were caused by Maya's attempt to restrain her during the murder.

The torn piece of fabric caught in the window latch led investigators to believe that the killer entered or exited through the window. However, further investigation revealed that Maya had used a magical spell to manipulate the environment and make it appear as though she had left the room through the door.

The shattered smartphone on the floor was a red herring, planted by Thomas Brown to mislead the investigation. The single drop of blood on the desk's edge was also a deliberate attempt to create confusion. Elvin's alibi checked out, but his teaching position gave him access to the university's resources and secrets, making him an unlikely suspect.

The true culprit was revealed when investigators discovered a hidden journal belonging to Maya. The entries detailed her growing obsession with Dr. Wong's research and her increasing paranoia about being exposed as a supernatural phenomenon herself. The final entry confirmed that Maya had committed the murder, using her knowledge of magic to cover her tracks.

In conclusion, the complex web of motives and alibis led investigators down a rabbit hole, but ultimately, the truth was revealed in the hidden journal belonging to Maya. Her personal connection to Dr. Wong, combined with her own research and paranoia, made her the perfect candidate for the crime.
