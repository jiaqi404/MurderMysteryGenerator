## Crime Scene
The crime scene was Bertha Jinglewhiff's office located in one of the ancient towers of Hogwarts Castle. The office was situated near the restricted section of the library and was easily accessible through a hidden passageway from the castle's east wing.

When Hagrid discovered the body, Bertha was found slumped over her desk, with her head resting on a stack of dusty tomes. Her eyes were frozen in a permanent stare, and her skin had taken on a pale, waxy complexion. A faint scent of old parchment and dust filled the air.

## Suspect Profiles
There were five suspects involved in Bertha's murder:

*   Lyra: An adventurer and cartographer with a professional relationship with Bertha.
*   Elvin: A professor of ancient runes at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with a close professional relationship with Bertha.
*   Maya: A researcher at the Lunar Library with a personal connection to Bertha through their shared interest in ancient magical languages.
*   Jeff: A student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who was desperate to uncover more information about his family's past.
*   Hiroharu Nakasuna: A public security demon hunter with no direct relationship to Bertha, but involved in the magical community.

## True Culprit
The true culprit behind Bertha Jinglewhiff's murder is Elvin. He was frustrated with her recent research on ancient magical languages and decided to silence her by using dark magic.
