## Crime Scene
The Musical Instruments Storage Room was in disarray, with shelves knocked over and instruments scattered about. The air was thick with dust, and the scent of old books and music filled the room. A large wooden workbench dominated the center of the space, where Aurora's body slumped against it. The shelf near her head had a torn piece of fabric caught in it, and a silver-tipped wand lay on the floor nearby.

## Suspect Profiles

### Jeff
Jeff seemed shaken by the event, but his alibi checked out. He claimed to have been studying for an exam in the library at the time of the murder, but he couldn't provide any witnesses to confirm it.

### Maya
Maya appeared nervous and on edge, fidgeting with her hands as she spoke about Aurora's research. She seemed particularly interested in the Echo Bonds connection, but her knowledge was sketchy at best.

### Elvin
Elvin was composed and collected, but his eyes seemed to hold a hint of sadness. He claimed to have been working late in his office at the time of the murder, but he couldn't provide any witnesses to confirm it.

### Lyra
Lyra seemed distant and detached, her eyes avoiding direct contact with anyone. She claimed to have been out on an expedition at the time of the murder, but she couldn't produce any concrete evidence to support her story.

## True Culprit

After careful investigation, it was revealed that Maya was the true culprit. The torn piece of fabric caught in the shelf belonged to her, and the silver-tipped wand found nearby was one of her own. However, what sealed her fate was the discovery of a hidden journal belonging to Aurora, detailing Maya's research on Echo Bonds.

It turned out that Maya had been using Aurora as a pawn in her game, manipulating her into uncovering secrets that would further her own research. When Aurora began to suspect the truth, Maya silenced her permanently. The faint marks of magic on the walls and shelves were a clever attempt to mislead investigators, but they ultimately led to Maya's downfall.

The investigation revealed that Maya had been using dark magic to conceal evidence and throw off suspicion. She was also using the Echo Bonds connection as a smokescreen, hoping to cover her own tracks.

In the end, justice was served, and Maya was brought to trial for the murder of Aurora Sinistra. Her motives may have seemed complex, but in the end, it was simply a case of obsession and desperation driving her actions.
