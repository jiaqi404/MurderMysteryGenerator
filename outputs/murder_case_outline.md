## Crime Scene
The Great Hall of the Wysteria Academy of Magic was in disarray when the body of Elwynn Asteria was discovered. The room, usually filled with the sound of laughter and learning, was instead shrouded in an eerie silence. The air was thick with the scent of burned incense and ozone, and a faint hum of magic lingered, like the whispers of forgotten spells.

## Suspect Profiles

### Jeff
Jeff's eyes darted nervously around the room as he spoke to the investigators. His alibi for the time of the murder seemed shaky at best, and his family's dark past made him a prime suspect. However, his fragile mental state and lack of motive made it difficult to pin anything on him.

### Maya
Maya's research on phantom friends had led her to investigate Elwynn's activities, but she claimed she didn't know the victim personally. Her empty expression and distant demeanor raised suspicions, but her expertise in Echo Bonds made her a valuable resource in unraveling the mystery.

### Elvin
Elvin's reputation as a respected teacher and innovative educator made him an unlikely suspect. However, his close relationship with Elwynn Asteria and his discovery of a spell to purify polluted magic energy hinted at a deeper motive. His calm demeanor and collected speech belied a potential for hidden anger.

### Hiroharu Nakasuna
Hiroharu's troubled past as a demon hunter had left emotional scars, but her dedication to justice made her a credible suspect. Her task force focused on eliminating the Devouring Demon had likely left her with a sense of purpose and drive. However, her lack of connection to Elwynn Asteria made it difficult to tie her directly to the crime.

### The Shadowy Figure
The Phantom friend researcher's existence was shrouded in mystery, but their connection to Elwynn's research was undeniable. Their ability to manipulate magic and feed on Elwynn's energy made them a formidable suspect.

## True Culprit

After conducting an exhaustive investigation, it became clear that Hiroharu Nakasuna was the true culprit behind Elwynn Asteria's murder. Her troubled past and drive for justice had led her to believe that Elwynn was connected to a dark force or supernatural entity. However, further analysis revealed that Elwynn was actually working with The Shadowy Figure, a manifestation of her own consciousness.

Hiroharu's demons had clouded her judgment, and she mistakenly believed that Elwynn was a threat. Her actions were motivated by a desire to protect herself and others from the supernatural forces she feared. The broken crystal orb, torn black silk fabric, and silver dust on the edge of the dais were all red herrings planted by Hiroharu to mislead the investigators.

The Shadowy Figure, however, had other plans. It had been feeding on Elwynn's magic, manipulating her research and actions to further its own agenda. When Hiroharu discovered this connection, she realized too late that she had made a grave mistake. The Shadowy Figure had manipulated Elwynn into revealing the location of the Great Hall, where it would be waiting for Hiroharu.

In the end, The Shadowy Figure eliminated both Elwynn Asteria and Hiroharu Nakasuna, using their combined magic to create an elaborate web of deception and misdirection. The Phantom friend researcher remained at large, its true intentions and motivations hidden behind a veil of mystery.
