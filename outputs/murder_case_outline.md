## Crime Scene
The abandoned warehouse on Katagiri Street was discovered by responding officers at 02:45 AM on March 15th, 2077. Upon entering the dimly lit room, they found Mayra Elara Vex in a seated position on the floor, her eyes frozen in a permanent stare. The air was thick with smoke and ozone from various tools and equipment scattered throughout the space. A faint scent of artificial lavender wafted through the air, possibly a lingering signature left by Mayra herself or someone else. The walls were adorned with cryptic messages scrawled in blood, seemingly from previous victims or clients.

## Suspect Profiles

### Jeff
- **Fingerprint Analysis**: A set of fingerprints matching those of a known cybernetic enhancement dealer were found on a nearby console. Further investigation revealed that the same individual had purchased several cyberware enhancements from an underground market.
- **Motivational Clues**: An anonymous message on Mayra's comms device hinted at Jeff's family history, referencing his great-grandfather's involvement in supernatural events.

### Hiroharu Nakasuna
- **Demonic Residue**: A faint demonic scent was detected near the crime scene, matching Hiroharu's known encounters with the Devouring Demon. Further analysis revealed a piece of torn fabric caught in the warehouse door's lock that matched Hiroharu's attire.
- **Psychological Evaluation**: Hiroharu's past traumas and suppressed emotions were evident during questioning, but she maintained her composure under pressure.

### Maya
- **Lunar Energy Signature**: A unique lunar energy signature was detected near the crime scene, matching Maya's work as a Lunar Lorekeeper. This signature seemed to be linked to the ritualistic nature of Mayra's murder.
- **Phantom Friendships**: An anonymous message on Mayra's comms device hinted at her desire for phantom friendships and comfort in her work.

### Elvin
- **Magic Residue**: A faint magical residue was detected near the crime scene, matching Elvin's known expertise as a wizard. Further analysis revealed an ancient spellbook belonging to Elvin, containing forbidden techniques.
- **Teaching Materials**: Mayra's encrypted data crystal contained cryptic messages referencing her time spent with Elvin, hinting at his involvement in the dark forces she encountered.

## True Culprit
After thorough investigation and analysis of evidence, it was revealed that Maya was the true culprit behind Mayra's murder. The lunar energy signature detected near the crime scene matched Maya's work as a Lunar Lorekeeper, and further analysis revealed her unique abilities allowed her to manipulate the ritualistic nature of the murder.

Maya's desire for phantom friendships and comfort in her work led her to seek out Mayra's skills as a hacker to further her own research. Using Mayra's expertise, Maya created an illusion of a supernatural entity, which she used to lure Mayra into the warehouse. Once inside, Maya performed a ritualistic murder, using Mayra's hacking skills to create a complex puzzle that would lead the investigators on a wild goose chase.

The anonymous message on Mayra's comms device was sent by Maya herself, trying to mislead the investigators and deflect suspicion from her own identity. The cyberpunk setting and emphasis on hacking and supernatural events added to the complexity of the case, making it challenging for the investigators to connect the dots between each suspect.

In the end, Maya's unique abilities as a Lunar Lorekeeper and her desire for phantom friendships led her down a dark path, resulting in the tragic murder of Mayra Elara Vex.
