## Crime Scene
The crime scene is located in a secluded area within the Wysteria Academy's castle walls, specifically in a laboratory deep beneath the earth. The room is situated near the academy's central hub, accessible through a secret passageway only known to authorized personnel. Upon examination, the victim's body was found in a state of rigor mortis, indicating that death had occurred several hours prior to discovery. Eryndor's eyes were open, gazing upwards towards the laboratory ceiling, and his skin had a pale, almost translucent quality. A faint scent of ozone hung around him, suggesting some residual magical energy.

## True Culprit
The true culprit is **Lyra Flynn**, who had been working closely with Eryndor on the top-secret project involving elemental magic. Lyra stood to gain significantly from Eryndor's research, which could lead to breakthroughs in magical energies. With Eryndor out of the way, she could take credit for his work and advance her own career.

The murder was committed using a combination of stealth and magical manipulation. Lyra had been sneaking into the laboratory at night to observe Eryndor's experiments and gather notes. On the night of the murder, she created a diversion by triggering a magical explosion in the nearby laboratory, which led Eryndor away from his experiment. Once he was alone, Lyra used her own magical abilities to knock him unconscious and then administered a potion that would allow her to cover her tracks.

To further deceive the investigation, Lyra planted evidence at the scene to point towards other suspects. She left the shattered crystal vial containing the glowing purple liquid on the workbench, as well as the torn piece of fabric caught in the door handle. The footprints leading from the laboratory to the ventilation shaft were a clever ruse, designed to lead investigators away from her own trail.

The cryptic notes and sketches in Eryndor's notebook were also carefully planted by Lyra, who had been secretly working on the project with him. These notes were meant to suggest that Eryndor was getting close to a major breakthrough, which would only serve to further fuel speculation about his untimely death.

In the end, it was Lyra's own ambition and desire for recognition that led her down the path of murder. Her carefully constructed alibi and clever manipulation of evidence made it seem as though the investigation would never uncover the truth – until now.
