## Crime Scene

The crime scene at Wysteria Magic Academy's East Wing laboratory was chaotic and disturbing. Elwynn Asteria's body lay prone on the floor, approximately 10 feet away from her workbench. The room was in disarray, with shelves knocked over and various pieces of equipment scattered across the floor. A small, flickering candle on Elwynn's workbench cast eerie shadows around the room.

A broken crystal vial containing a faint, shimmering liquid near Elwynn's workbench seemed to be an afterthought, as if someone had carelessly dropped it while fleeing the scene. The torn piece of black cloth caught in the laboratory door handle suggested that the killer may have been in a hurry or was trying to conceal their identity.

The air was thick with the scent of ozone and burnt incense, hinting at a possible magical explosion or experiment gone wrong. Elwynn's enchanted wand, a rare and valuable item, was missing from her person, adding to the mystery surrounding her death.

## Suspect Profiles

### Jeff

Jeff's timid demeanor and socially withdrawn nature made him seem like an unlikely suspect. However, his family's complex history and involvement in supernatural events created a motive for revenge. His great-grandfather's past transgressions against Elwynn's family could have driven Jeff to seek justice, even if it meant taking the law into his own hands.

### Maya

Maya's research focus on Echo Bonds and her yearning for connection made her seem like an unlikely suspect at first. However, her detachment and obsessive nature could have led her to uncover dark secrets about Elwynn's family or the circumstances of her death. Maya's emotions were masked behind her detached persona, making it difficult to read her true intentions.

### Elvin

Elvin's reputation as a respected teacher was built on his innovative teaching methods and humor. However, his involvement in magical disputes and disagreements with colleagues could have led to a heated confrontation with Elwynn. As the Head of the Student Expedition Team, Elvin's authority was undeniable, but his temper and pride could have gotten the better of him.

### Hiroharu Nakasuna

Hiroharu's troubled past and sense of purpose made her seem like a force to be reckoned with. Her involvement in demon hunting and tracking the Devouring Demon created a motive for eliminating anyone who stood in her way. However, her dedication to justice and protection could have also driven her to uncover the truth behind Elwynn's death.

## True Culprit

The true culprit was revealed to be none other than Maya. Her obsessive research and detached nature had led her to uncover dark secrets about Elwynn's family, including their involvement in a powerful magical artifact. Maya's emotions and motivations were complex, driven by both a desire for connection and a need to uncover the truth.

Maya's actions on the night of January 10th, 1999, seemed calculated and deliberate. She had been searching for Elwynn's family records and had discovered their involvement in a powerful artifact. The broken crystal vial and shimmering liquid contained a rare magical essence used in the artifact's creation.

Hiroharu's research on demons and the Devouring Demon led her to believe that Elwynn's death was connected to a larger supernatural event. However, Hiroharu's investigation had actually uncovered Maya's true identity as the killer. The torn piece of black cloth caught in the laboratory door handle and the faint magical residue marks on the floor were evidence of a struggle between Maya and another suspect.

Elvin's involvement in magical disputes with Elwynn made him a prime suspect, but his reputation as a respected teacher and mentor had protected him from suspicion. Jeff's family history and involvement in supernatural events created a motive for revenge, but he was an unlikely killer given his timid nature.

Maya's true intentions were masked behind her detached persona, making it difficult to read her emotions and motivations. However, the discovery of the rare magical essence and Elwynn's family records revealed Maya's obsession with uncovering the truth, leading to a tragic conclusion that would change the course of Wysteria Magic Academy forever.
