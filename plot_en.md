## True Culprit 
The true culprit behind Emily J. Miller's murder is **Sarah Lee**. Sarah, Emily's roommate and best friend, had been experiencing financial difficulties due to her recent divorce. She had been relying heavily on Emily for emotional support, but Emily recently discovered some of Sarah's secrets, including a hidden bank account filled with money from her ex-husband.

Sarah felt that Emily was going to expose her deepest secrets, which could ruin her reputation and put her in a difficult financial situation. In a fit of rage, Sarah snapped and killed Emily. She then covered up the crime by making it look like a robbery gone wrong, leaving behind a torn piece of fabric caught in the window lock.

The broken wine glass on the coffee table was a red herring, planted to make it seem like the killer was someone who had been drinking before the murder. However, forensic analysis revealed that the glass had been cleaned and wiped clean, indicating that Sarah had indeed thrown it away after committing the crime.

Sarah's motive for the crime was not just about financial gain, but also about protecting her reputation and relationships with others. She knew that if Emily exposed her secrets, it would damage her relationships with friends and family, leading to a downward spiral of shame and embarrassment.

As the investigation continued, detectives discovered that Sarah had an alibi for the time of the murder, which made it seem like she was nowhere near the crime scene. However, further analysis revealed that Sarah's phone had been in close proximity to the building during the time of the murder, indicating that she had indeed been at the scene.

In the end, Sarah's guilt was proven through a combination of forensic evidence, eyewitness testimony, and her own admission of the crime. The case was closed, but the community was left to wonder how someone so close to Emily could have committed such a heinous act.
