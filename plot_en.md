## True Culprit
The true culprit behind Marcus Reed's murder was Sofia Patel, the business partner of Cygnus Corp. Sofia had been secretly negotiating with Lexi to sell out to NovaTech Inc., but when Lexi decided to eliminate Marcus instead, Sofia felt betrayed. She saw an opportunity to gain control of Cygnus and eliminate her former partner.

Sofia's alibi for the time of the murder was shaky at best, and investigators discovered that she had been in a heated argument with Marcus just hours before his death. Further investigation revealed that Sofia had access to the office building's security system and had used it to create a fake video feed to distract the guards while she entered Marcus's office.

The motive for the crime was clear: Sofia wanted to eliminate Marcus Reed and take control of Cygnus Corp for herself. She had been manipulating Lexi, using her charm and business acumen to gain trust, but ultimately, she saw her as a threat and eliminated her.
