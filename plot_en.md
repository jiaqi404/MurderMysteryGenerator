**Detailed Background and Timeline**

The city of Neo-Eden was a hub for technological advancements, with towering skyscrapers and neon-lit streets that seemed to pulse with energy. It was here that Julian Saint Clair, the wealthy entrepreneur, held court, his company, Saint Clair Enterprises, being at the forefront of cutting-edge cybersecurity solutions.

Maya Blackwood, the freelance security consultant, had been hired by Saint Clair to investigate a potential vulnerability in his company's systems. Unbeknownst to Maya, however, Saint Clair had been working on a secret project, codenamed "Eclipse," which aimed to create an AI capable of surpassing human intelligence. As Maya delved deeper into the investigation, she discovered that Eclipse was more than just a research project – it was a potential game-changer in the world of cybersecurity.

Meanwhile, Dr. Elianore Quasar, the brilliant scientist, had been working on his own AI project, which he believed would revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence. However, his work was being threatened by Saint Clair's Eclipse project, and he saw the victim as a major obstacle to his success.

Kaito Yamato, the former member of "The Phantom Phreaks," had been hired by Saint Clair to investigate a potential security breach in his company's systems. However, Kaito soon discovered that the breach was not what it seemed – it was a deliberate attempt to sabotage Eclipse and discredit Dr. Quasar.

Lila Earthsong, the spiritual leader of "The Neo-Tribes," had been using her charisma and psychic abilities to gather followers and promote her philosophy of interconnectedness. However, some critics accused her of manipulating and exploiting her followers for personal gain. The victim had discovered her true intentions and was planning to expose her, which would have damaged her reputation and influence.

Ryker "Raven" Lee, the former special forces operative, had been involved in a previous operation that went sour, resulting in the death of one of his former comrades. The victim was responsible for the tragedy, which led Ryker seeking revenge.
