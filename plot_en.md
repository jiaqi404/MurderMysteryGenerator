## Culprit Details - The identity of the true culprit, with a clear explanation of their motive and method of committing the murder.

The true culprit is Olivia Lee. Her motive for killing Emily was twofold: she wanted revenge against Emily for sabotaging her chances with Michael, and she also wanted to protect her secret relationship with him from being exposed. Olivia's method of committing the murder was clever and calculated. She had been watching Ethan's movements all night, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. As Emily and Ethan were dancing on the floor, Olivia snuck into the gymnasium and shot Emily with a gun she had concealed in her art bag. The torn fabric caught in the door was from her black hoodie, which she wore to blend in with the shadows.
